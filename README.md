This site is built using the Jekyll framework. Jekyll is a static site builder. It allows the site source code to be written using various templates, with content in markdown, and then builds the site into html to be deployed.

The site is currently hosted in github pages...

## FORMS

As Jekyll produces a static site, and GitHub Pages (which may end up hosting the site...) does not allow server site code to be run, forms are configured via formspree. [formspree](https://formspree.io/guides/jekyll/). This shouldn't need to be touched, but the login information is in the handover document.

# TO DO:
* gallery
* calendar of upcoming events on home page
* automated records
* add photos to competitions page
* links to other resources
* update steves information
* pw protected members area with links to whatsapp gc's and sign up forms
