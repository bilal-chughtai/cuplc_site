## FORMS

As Jekyll produces a static site, and GitHub Pages (which may end up hosting the site...) does not allow server site code to be run, forms are configured via formspree. [formspree](https://formspree.io/guides/jekyll/). This shouldn't need to be touched, but the login information is in the handover document.
