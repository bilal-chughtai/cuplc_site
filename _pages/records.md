## Student Records

This section is for records made by CUPLC members while they were students at the University. This can be any type of student, including undergraduate, graduate, post-graduate, masters, PhD etc. They must be achieved either at a Cambridge-Oxford Varsity match or an IPF-approved unequipped competition. Records remain after the student has graduated, until they are beaten by another student lifter.

## Alumni Records

This section is for records made by alumni who were CUPLC members while they were students at the University. This is to show appreciation to our oldies, many of whom still train with us. Also, as Powerlifting is a lifelong sport, it allows us to see the great things that can be achieved after many many years of training. They must be achieved at an IPF-approved unequipped competition.
