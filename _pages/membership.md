Want to be part of the **strongest** club in Cambridge?  Look no further. Membership offers access to the following perks:

1. Weekly team training sessions (including SBD clinics)
2. Access to our powerlifting bars in the Uni Sports Centre
3. In house competitions, including Novice Comp and Varsity Trials in Michalemas and Cuppers in Summer
4. Opportunities to compete for the University at Varsity and BUCS
5. Discounted physiotherapy
7. Access to our private Facebook and WhatsApp groups
8. Frequent socials
9. Stash 

If you'd like to get a feel for the club before joining, feel free to come and chat to us at the University Sports Centre gym. There's usually a good group of us training there most evenings - we should be hard to miss! If it's the start of the year, sign up to our freshers mailing list and come to our introductory sessions instead.

To clarify, CUPLC membership does not include access to the University Sports Centre gym where a lot of us train together throughout the week. This is a separate gym membership. You however don't need to have a University Sports Centre membership to come to the weekly Team Training sessions as they are paid for by CUPLC.Â

Any questions regarding club membership should be directed towards the [club secretary](mailto: bjht3@cam.ac.uk).
