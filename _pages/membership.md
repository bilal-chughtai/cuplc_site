## Gym membership

Team training room sessions (TTR sessions) are funded by CUPLC and you don't need a gym membership to attend these. 

CUPLC membership unfortunately does not include access to the University Sports Centre gym where a lot of us train together throughout the week. This is a separate gym membership.


Any questions regarding club membership should be directed towards the [club secretary](mailto:iw327@cam.ac.uk).
