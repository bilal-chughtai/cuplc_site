## Membership

{% include video id="fTGfiErl7Og" provider="youtube" %}

Want to be part of the **strongest** club in Cambridge?  Look no further. Membership offers access to the following perks:

1. Weekly team training sessions (including SBD clinics)
2. Access to our powerlifting bars in the Uni Sports Centre
3. In house competitions (novice comp, varsity trials, cuppers)
4. Opportunities to compete for the University at Varsity and BUCS
5. Discounted physiotherapy and sports massages
6. Access to the CUPLC website resources
7. Access to the private Facebook and WhatsApp groups
8. Frequent socials
9. Stash

If you'd like to get a feel for the club before joining, feel free to come and chat to us at the University Sports Centre gym. There is usually a good group of us training there most evenings - we should be hard to miss!

To clarify, CUPLC membership does not include access to the University Sports Centre gym where a lot of us train together throughout the week. This is a separate gym membership. You don't need to have a University Sports Centre membership to come to the weekly Team Training sessions as they are paid for by CUPLC.
