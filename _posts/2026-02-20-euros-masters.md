Dave is our mid-40s M1 74&nbsp;kg alumnus who makes a good habit of troubling the
podium at Europeans and Worlds and collecting squat golds on a regular basis.
However, the top step at international level has always eluded him with five silvers
and a bronze…until now! In the icy hallows of Oulu, northern Finland, in mid-Feb
where temperatures were a balmy -20&nbsp;°C, Dave finally got the gold at European
Masters by a margin of nearly 50&nbsp;kg and extended his European squat record by
0.5&nbsp;kg to 263.5&nbsp;kg to boot.

His bogey lift of bench was a sub-par 132.5&nbsp;kg that was
enough for 4&nbsp;th , but a 262.5&nbsp;kg deadlift was respectable and secured silver. He also
wasn’t too far away from the podium for M1 men overall coming 5&nbsp;th out of 55 lifters.
A couple of weeks of recovery training before 14 weeks of head down, butt up, to do
some damage at British Masters in June which will be in Edinburgh!
