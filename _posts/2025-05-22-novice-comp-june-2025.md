## How it works

You will get put into a group with around 10 other lifters. Your group will start with squats. Your opening squat should be very light, typically 10-15kg below your max.

Everyone gets a chance to do one squat, before we go round the group for everyone's second squat. Then you get one final attempt at your squat where people often try and go for a PB. 

The other groups then do the same, and when they are done your group will do their bench attempts.

The final lift will be deadlifts.
