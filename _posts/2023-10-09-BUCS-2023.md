The CUPLC presence could be felt at yet another year of BUCS, with members turning up as referees, platform crew,
table crew, and of course as lifters and handlers.

## Day 1

The first day of BUCS saw the U47, U52, and U57 women take to the platform in the morning, with the U59 and U74 men in the afternoon.
Vikki Li would be competing in the U52 class, with a personal goal of a 290kg total to achieve a full-blue. Katie O’Flaherty and Anna Clay were nominated
5th and 2nd in the U57 class respectively, and so were looking to dominate the podium. Yaron had drawn the short straw and
was tasked with handling two of CUPLC’s most hyper lifters, while CUPLC’s favourite supportive SO Adrian came along to handle Anna.

Vikki went 3 for 3 on squats, with an easy 100kg on her third attempt to hit a 5kg PB despite only doing three sets in
the warmup room. With Flight A squats complete, it was time for CUPLC’s strong U57s in Flight C to start warming up.
Now, while many powerlifters claim to lift heavy in order to fight their demons, Katie took things one step further by
carrying out a full-blown exorcism as she warmed up for squats, contorting her body in ways that no powerlifter ever should.

And yet despite that, Vikki thought it looked fun enough to join in. Katie’s opener moved as expected, but her second
attempt fell off her back after stepping on the centre spotter’s foot! Fortunately, the jury was in a good mood that
day and offered Katie an extra attempt, which she absolutely smashed, matching her comp PB. She took a 5kg jump for her
third attempt, leaving her with a 122.5kg squat and 3 out of 4 successful squats. In the meantime, Anna easily squatted
a massive 132.5kg on her third attempt, redeeming herself after missing it at Varsity.

Next up for the bench press – Vikki quietly built up her total once again going 3 for 3 and achieving a 57.5kg bench.

Katie opened with her previous comp PB, then took a 2.5kg jump to 62.5kg on her second attempt. On her third attempt,
she managed to press 65kg but not without jumping the command. Anna’s second attempt was a matched comp PB, so she
added 2.5kg for her third attempt of 72.5kg. After a fight with the bar that the commentators described as “the best
grind so far”, she was given three white lights and a new personal record!

Finally, the much-anticipated deadlifts. Vikki’s opener flew, so she took a big 10kg jump up to 132.5kg to hit her
290kg total and get the full-blue. Yaron then submitted a massive 145kg for the third attempt, which would match the
current BUCS deadlift record and pull Vikki into third place. After Vikki’s secret twin sister, who was also contending
for third place, missed her final deadlift, Vikki’s final attempt was dropped to a far less terrifying 140kg. She
stepped onto the platform, hyped up on Christian hymns (not a joke), and pulled the bar with everything she had left.
The bar moved slowly, but she locked it out – getting two white lights and the third place position! Her joy would be
short-lived as the jury, who by now seemed to be not having such a good day, decided to overturn her lift, knocking her
back down to 5th place. Next up would be Katie and Anna. Katie was aiming for third place in the U57s, and her first two
attempts moved well, with Katie matching her PB with her second pull. Finally, 142.5kg was loaded on the bar, and Katie
got in the zone with Encanto’s ‘We Don’t Talk About Bruno’ (and frankly, Yaron would have preferred if she didn’t sing
about Bruno either). As Katie locked out her final deadlift, it occurred to her that she had successfully pulled herself
into 3rd place! Unfortunately though, the advantage of the deadlift battle was not on her side, and she had to retreat
to the stands to watch two more lifters attempt to knock her off the podium. The first of them missed her third attempt,
and for a moment it looked like Katie would keep her spot. However, the second lifter did manage to steal away the
podium position. Meanwhile, Anna was busy making sure nobody could steal her 2nd place medal (foreshadowing). Her opener
moved with ease once again, and 10kg was added to the bar for a successful 155kg second attempt. Finally, Anna attempted
160kg for her third, and the bar crept up her legs in what would be another fantastic fight. However, she locked it out
so fast that her shoulder rebounded forwards, and the referees penalised her for having a soft lockout. Despite the red
lights, she finished up in 2nd place.

It was therefore a surprise when Katie was given the bronze medal, and Anna was not called up to the podium (due to an
unfortunate computing error that meant Open lifters were grouped separately from Junior lifters on the scoresheet).
However, after some excellent negotiating by the CUPLC supporters, Anna was subsequently awarded with her silver medal
(and Katie quietly left the venue with her accidental bronze).

After all the drama of the morning lifting, Brandon Teh would surely have an easy time in the afternoon… right?

Brandon continues to pretend to be an U74, this time weighing in at a hefty 71.1kg, and was in safe hands with Charlie
and Vikki sticking around to handle him. His opening squat looked easy, but his quads began to cramp. After applying
enough Deep Heat to make a dragon sweat, he came out for the second attempt, just 2.5kg below his comp PB. It moved
slowly, but well enough that he slapped on another 5kg for a big 225kg third attempt despite the other leg now cramping
up. After what might be the toughest grind of his powerlifting career, Brandon traded his ability to walk for a new
squat PB. As he crawled off the platform, he could be heard reminding everyone around him for the 47th time that day
that he wasn’t really even planning to try hard that day, just in case they thought he found that lift heavy.

Bench press went with barely a hitch (other than, you’ve guessed it, more cramping), with Brandon finishing the event
with three more good lifts and huge 145kg bench press to match his previous personal record.

As Brandon warmed up for deadlifts, he continued to cramp. While his opener moved with lightning speed, he once again
hobbled off the platform. After a 15kg jump, his second attempt moved similarly well. Brandon sat in 2nd place at this
point, and for this third attempt took a considerably smaller 7.5kg jump up to 257.5kg to solidify his position on the
podium. His final pull was just as rapid, and as he walked off the platform, he nearly fell as his legs reminded him once
again that they don’t work like they used to before.

To everyone’s surprise, Brandon was able to step onto the podium unassisted to receive his silver medal. We can’t wait
to see what he is able to achieve at Junior Nats in a few weeks! Maybe even a bench press PB… (Brandon would go on to
win nationals, albeit without a bench press PB).
