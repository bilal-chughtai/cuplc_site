In the process of creating this new CUPLC website, I stumbled upon a much older version, hosted on the [Student Run Computing Facility](https://www.srcf.net/), and dating back to around 2015-2016. If you havn't got time to peruse the entire site, I'd personally recommend checking out some of the old [competition reports/results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/archived_site/reports.htm), dating all the way back to 2001. Or perhaps our mix of old [club records]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/archived_site/records/club.htm) - I personally would endorse a return of the curl off. For a deeper dive, the entire site is archived here:
