<h2>Varsity 2006</h2>
<p class="reg">Oxford have failed to field a team or fix a date for Varsity 2006. Cambridge therefore take the win by default.</p>
<p class="reg">The Cambridge team was well-prepared to take Oxford on with a much more even distribution of experience than last year. However, disappointingly, Oxford failed to respond constructively to repeated requests to fix a date and venue.</p>
<p class="reg">The team remains keen to compete against Oxford but at present it looks unlikely that anything will change. Therefore we will probably have to wait till next year for another Varsity match.</p>
