<p class="reg">A tight victory for Oxford in one of the most intense varsity competitions in CUPLC's history. Our three top lifters were Alp Notghi (totalling 540kgs in the three lifts at a bodyweight of 79kg, only 4 points away from the Full Blue standard), Krish Mahbubani (totalling 262.5 at 50kg and being the highest scoring girl the club has ever had), and Adam Comer (totalling 475kgs at 82.5kgs). High scoring was ubiquitous this year with 9 lifters surpassing the half blue standard in wilks points: Krish Mahbubani (337.2), Adam Comer (318.2), Alex Katsis (315.7), Alex Freer (314.5), Dan Ivstan (312.9), Calvin Wakeford (310.9), Oliver Gam (309.6), Max Frenzel (306.3), and Wilberth Solano (306.2).</p>
<p class="reg">Unfortunately heroic water loss efforts proved too much for our high scoring lifters Andrew Hodgson and Angus Higgins who were unable to attain their opening lifts in the squat and bench respectively. Although Andrew injured his back during his squat attempts he still managed to top the highest bench press of the competition with a token 150kg.</p>
