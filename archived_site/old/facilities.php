<p>The Club trains in the Powerlifting Room at Fenners - which is NOT the same as the Fitness Suite! (Ask at reception if you are unsure.)
</p>
<p>Club equipment includes:
<ul>
<li>competition-standard squat-rack and bench;</li>
<li>well over 300kg of competition-standard weights;</li>
<li>two competition-standard powerlifting bars (20kg) plus collars;</li>
<li>one competition-standard women's weightlifting bar (15kg);</li>
<li>two competition-standard men's weightlifting bar (20kg);</li>
<li>assorted non-competition bars, collars, weight plates and dumbbells;</li>
<li>power-rack.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Despite the large quantity of equimpment, the Powerlifting Room itself is fairly small, so we limit the number of people who can train at a time.
