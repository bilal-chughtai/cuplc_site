<H1>Benefits of Weight Training</H1>
<p>It is becoming increasingly clear that strength training plays an important component in general health and fitness. It used to be thought that aerobic fitness was more important, and thus that exercises like running, swimming, cycling and rowing were the most important for health. However weight training is now seen as an essential component of a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Done properly, resistance training for strength can increase bone density, improve joint integrity and mobility, improve the strength of your back, and protect against back, joint and muscle injury.
</p>
<p>Due to the increases in bone density associated with regular weight training, it is particularly recommended for those at risk of osteoperosis (especially women), since increased bone density is the decisive factor in preventing osteoperosis later in life.
</p>
<p>And, of course, weight training makes you stronger! Strength, and an accurate assessment of your own strength, can be very useful in everyday life, and in various emergency and self-defence situations.
</p>
<p>For the vain, weight training (as opposed to other forms of exercise) offers unparalleled control over the shape of your physique - from Incredible Hulk to J-Lo. (Well, nearly...) Some people worry about bulking up in an undesirable way, but in fact you only bulk up if you adopt a training program specifically designed for the purpose. You can set your own goals. In almost every case, lifting weights will have a positive impact on the way you look.
</p>
<p>What are the downsides? Provided you are healthy to begin with, and you train correctly, there aren't many. Risks can include back and shoulder problems, but compared to other sports, problems and injuries are rare. When they do arise they usually arise from training errors - poor form or incautious weight selection. In fact weight training forms a central part of many physiotherapy rehabilitation programs.
</p>
<p>So we think that weight training, done right, can benefit almost anyone. Nevertheless, remember that you undertake any training program at your own risk. If in doubt, consult a doctor.
