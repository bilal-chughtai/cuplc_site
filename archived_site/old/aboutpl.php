<H1>About Powerlifting</H1>
<p>Powerlifting is just one of a large range of strength sports. 
The competition consists of three lifts, the Back Squat, Bench Press and the Dead Lift.
Each competitior has three attempts at each type of lift 
(he/she performs three squat attempts, three bench presses, and three dead lifts). 
<B> NOTE</B> Three attempts at each lift in total, not at each weight!</p>

<H3>Lift 1: The Squat</H3>
<IMG SRC="images/squat.jpg" ALIGN=left width=200 border=0>
A barbell is positioned across the rear of the lifter's shoulders (the lifter first 
removes the bar from a rack which is roughly at shoulder height). From a standing position 
with the bar across the shoulders, the lifter bends the knees and lowers into the 'squat' 
position until the thighs are roughly parallel with the ground. From this position the lifter 
then drives with the legs in order to return to the stnding position. The aim is very simply to 
do this for one lift only, with the most weight on the bar!

<H3>Lift 2: The Bench Press</H3>
<IMG SRC="images/bench.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=200 border=0>
The bench press probably requires very little explanation! The lifter lies on his/her back on a bench, 
holding the bar at arms length. The bar is slowly lowered to the chest, where it is held for a short 
(and 'visible') pause, before being pressed back to arms length. As with the squat, to win the lifter 
must do this for one repetition with more weight than anyone else!

<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td>
<H3>Lift 3: The Dead Lift</H3>
<img src="images/dead.jpg" align=left width=200 border=0>This is perhaps the simplest of the three competition lifts in powerlifting. The lifter begins with the 
bar on the floor in front of him/her. He then grips the bar with both hands and very simply tries to 
stand up with the weight.

<H2>How places are decided</H3>
The largest single lift that a lifter has achieved in each of the individual lifts is added together to 
give a total of the three lifts. Simply, the lifter with the largest total wins!</P>

<H2>Questions & Answers</H2>
<H4>Do powerlifters only do these three exercises?</H4>
<p>The squat, bench press and deadlift are the competition lifts. In training, powerlifters regularly employ many other exercises for the sake of muscular balance, to avoid injury and to assist with the competition lifts.
</p>
<H4>Isn't it an unfair advantage if one lifter is bigger than another?</H4>
<p>
Powerlifting is competed in a number of bodyweight classes, so lifters only compete against others of 
similar weight. In some competitions, including team events (such as the Varsity Match), lifters 
compete directly against each other at all weights. In this instance a mathematical formula (the Wilkes Formula)
is used to adjust each lifter's total according to bodyweight so that no-one has an unfair advantage.
</p>
<H4>I couldn't be a powerlifter, I'm not huge!?</H4>
<p>
In fact, many powerlifters are not the huge, obviously muscular people everyone assumes. The sport can be 
particularly competitive at the lower bodyweight classes, and in fact the Oxford 1st team in the last Varsity 
match were almost all below 75kg bodyweight!
</p>
<p>
Don't let a perceived lack of size or strength put you off, have a go at powerlifting and you never know, 
you might just enjoy it.
</p>
<H4>Isn't it true that all powerlifters do drugs?</H4>
<p>
Also not true. Powerlifting, along with Weightlifting and Athletics, is incredibly heavily subject to drug testing
at all age and ability levels in the UK. This means that Powerlifting and weightlifting are two of the cleanest 
sports around in the UK now.
